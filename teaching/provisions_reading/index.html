  <h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
  <h3>Provision</h3>
  <p>A <em>provision</em> is an <em>uncertain</em> liability.</p>
  <p>It is uncertain in terms of the <em>timing</em> and/or <em>amount</em> of the future outflow of resources that it entails.</p>
  <div class='example'>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Tan Co faces a lawsuit from an aggrieved customer. Tan Co will probably lose this lawsuit and face some damages, according to its legal expert. The company has recorded a liability named &quot;provision for damages from lawsuit&quot; in the amount of $100,000, to reflect the expected damages arising from the lawsuit.</p>
</div>

<h3>Contingent liability</h3>

<p>A <em>contingent liability</em> is a potential liability that does not satisfy the criteria to be recorded on the balance-sheet as a provision. For example, the amount of loss may not be reliably estimable; or the chances of any loss may be less than 50%.</p>
<p>A contingent liability is required to be disclosed in the notes, and only in the notes. It should not be recorded as a liability on the balance-sheet.</p>


<div class='example'>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Cheong Co faces a lawsuit from a disgruntled ex-employee. The chances of losing the lawsuit are significant, but more likely than not, the company will not lose and will not face any damages.</p>
<p>In this situation, the company discloses the lawsuit in the notes only, for example: &quot;the company faces a lawsuit from a disgruntled ex-employee. While there is some chance of facing damages, the company expects this lawsuit to be dismissed.&quot;</p>
</div>

<h3>Contingent asset</h3>

<p>A contingent asset is an uncertain potential asset. If the chances of realizing any benefit from the uncertain asset are greater than 50%, (probable), then the asset is disclosed <em>in the notes only</em>.</p>
<p>It should not be recorded in the balance sheet unless the chances of realizing any benefit are close to 100% (virtually certain).</p>

<div class='example'>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Yong Co has sued a supplier for damages arising from a faulty part. The lawyer for Yong Co is of the opinion that Yong Co will win the lawsuit and will most likely be awarded $100,000 in damages.</p>
<p>In this situation, the company discloses the potential award in the notes only, for example: &quot;the company has lodged a lawsuit against a supplier. We anticipate that the company will win the lawsuit and will potentially be awarded damages in the amount of around $100,000 (not reflected in the financial statements)&quot;.</p>
</div>

<h3>Liability</h3>

<p>A liability is a <em>present obligation</em> arising from a <em>past event</em>.</p>
<p>The obligation is <em>legal</em> or <em>constructive</em>.</p>

<div class='example'>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Kwok Co has a current policy for their customer service hotline that if a service representative does not respond within 30 minutes, the caller will receive a $5 voucher. Does this lead to a present obligation based on a past event?</p>
<a href="javascript: void(0);" onClick="toggle('ex1_soln')">
Click here to toggle viewing the solution.
</a>
<div id="ex1_soln" style="display:none;">
<p>This does <em>not</em> constitute an obligation <em>in the present</em>. An obligation may arise <em>in future</em> if a service representative actually fails to answer a call within 30 minutes (a future event). We do not record any liability until that trigger happens.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3>Legal obligation</h3>

<p>A legally binding obligation is one where the counterparty can enforce its claim in a court of law.</p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Chng Co has purchased inventory from a supplier and has an outstanding trade payable of $100. This payable represents a <em>legal obligation</em>. If Chng Co fails to pay the supplier, Chng Co will be in breach of contract, violating contract law; and the aggrieved supplier can seek legal remedies against Chng Co.</p>
</div>

<h3>Constructive obligation</h3>

<p>A <em>constructive obligation</em> is one where the company has made an announcement or taken some actions that have created (constructed) a reasonable expectation that it will fulfil some commitment, even where it is not legally required to fulfil that commitment. In this situation, the commitment is a constructive obligation.</p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>An oil company sets up an oil rig. It is not required by law to clean up the seabed at the end of the oil rig life. But, the company website has a policy statement that it is the company policy to always clean up the seabed when decommissioning an oil rig. Furthermore, the company has a history of having done so with all its oil rigs in the past. By its actions and its public announcement, the company has constructively established a commitment to clean up the seabed for this oil rig. A constructive obligation exists.</p>
</div>

<h3>Past event</h3>

<p>In order to establish whether an obligation arises from a past event, we test if the company can avoid meeting that obligation by taking some future action (other than settling the liability). If they can do so, then the obligation depends on their not taking that future action and not on anything that happened in the past. So there is no past obligating event and the obligation does not lead to a liability.</p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>
An airline owns an aircraft. The government has a mandatory requirement that the aircraft owner must perform a safety overhaul every three years. The next mandatory overhaul is due next year. Does the airline have a present obligation arising from a past event?
</p>
<a href="javascript: void(0);" onClick="toggle('ex2_soln')">

</a>
<div id="ex2_soln" style="display:none;">
<p>No, there is no obligating past event. The airline can sell the aircraft before the overhaul is due, and thereby avoid the overhaul.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="recognition">Recognition Criteria</h2>

<h3>Criteria to recognize a provision</h3>

<p>In order to recognize a provision, all three of the criteria below should be satisfied:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a present obligation arising from a past event.</li>
<li>It is <em>probable</em> that there will be some loss (outflow of resources) in future arising from the obligation. <em>Probable</em> means <em>more likely than not</em> or greater than 50% probability.</li>
<li>The amount of the future loss arising from the provision can be <em>reliably estimated</em>.</li>
</ol>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>
Lynn Co faces a lawsuit from a customer, who claims that they were sold a dud product by Lynn. According to the lawyer for Lynn Co, there is a probability of <span class="ex3_prob"></span> percent that Lynn Co will lose the case and be forced to pay damages. The customer is demanding damages in the amount of $<span class="ex3_damages_ask"></span>. But in the expert opinion of the company lawyer, the damages if any would be around $<span class="ex3_damages_est"></span>, <span class="ex3_reliable"></span>Is this a provision?
</p>

<div id="ex3_soln" style="display:none;">
<p><span class="ex3_prob_test"></span></p>
<p><span class="ex3_amount"></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<h3>Criteria to disclose a contingent liability</h3>

In order to disclose a contingent liability, both of the following conditions should be satisfied:

<ol>
<li>
There should be a present obligation or a <em>potential</em> present obligation (it need not be firmly established), based on a <em>past event</em>. There must be a past obligating event.
</li>
<li>
The chances of a future resource outflow arising from the obligation should be <em>possible</em>, but not <em>remote</em>. We can interpret <em>possible</em> as a probability that is significantly greater than 0, while <em>remote</em> implies a small, negligible probability close to 0.
</li>
</ol>

<p>These criteria are broader than those to recognize a provision. For example, if the probability of a loss is less than 50 percent (but significantly greater than 0), then we can recognize a contingent liability but not a provision. For another example, if the probability of a loss is greater than 50 percent but the amount of the loss cannot be estimated, then we cannot recognize a provision, but we should still disclose a contingent liability in the notes.</p> 

<h3>Flowchart for applying recognition criteria</h3>

</p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>
A company sells goods under a two-year warranty. Based on past history and engineering guidance, the company has reliable standards on the proportion of defective goods that are likely to lead to warranty repairs. The expected cost of each warranty repair is also a well-established standard cost based on engineering guidance. Is this a provision or a contingent liability?
</p>
<a href="javascript: void(0);" onClick="toggle('ex4_soln')">
Click here to toggle viewing the solution.
</a>
<div id="ex4_soln" style="display:none;">
<p>When the company sells goods, it incurs a contractual obligation (legally binding) to honor the warranty. So the warranty obligation arising from past sales is a legal obligation, which is a present obligation based on a past event (the sale of goods).</p>
<p>In the typical situation, it is more likely than not that at least some warranty claims will occur. So the outflow is more likely than not. (There may be some atypical situations where the product quality is so extremely good that we can safely deem it unlikely that there will be any warranty claims at all. But let us not assume such an extreme scenario without supporting evidence--not given here.)</p>
<p>The amount of the loss can be reliably estimated using well-established and objective historical data and standard costs.</p>
<p>Therefore, the conditions to record a provision are satisfied. There is a warranty provision.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p></p>
<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>
A steel manufacturing company has a blast furnace with a lining that needs replacement every three years under engineering standards. Should the company record a provision for the future cost of replacing the lining? Should they record a contingent liability?
</p>
<a href="javascript: void(0);" onClick="toggle('ex5_soln')">
Click here to toggle viewing the solution.
</a>
<div id="ex5_soln" style="display:none;">
<p>The company is under no legal obligation to replace the lining. Even if a constructive obligation could be asserted, it would depend on the company&#39;s future actions (they could sell or otherwise dispose of the blast furnace before the lining needs to be replaced).</p> 
<p>There is therefore no present obligation based on a past event. There is therefore no provision. There is also no contingent liability (which requires a past obligating event).</p>
<p>The standard-setters suggest in their guidance on a similar illustrative example in the standard (SFRS(I) 1-37 IG Example 11A) that the accumulated depreciation on the lining plays a somewhat similar information role to a provision. It warns of the decline in value of the lining and the need to replace it as it nears its replacement date.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>
An airline owns an aircraft. The government has a mandatory requirement that the aircraft owner must perform a safety overhaul every three years. The next mandatory overhaul is due next year. Should the airline record a provsion for the forthcoming overhaul? Should they record a contingent liability?

<div id="ex6_soln" style="display:none;">
<p>No and no.</p> 
<p>There is no obligating past event. The airline can sell the aircraft before the overhaul is due, and thereby avoid the overhaul.</p>

<p> Therefore, the conditions to record a provision are not satisfied. There is no provision.</p>

<p>Since there is no obligating past event, the conditions to record a contingent liability are also not satisfied. There is no contingent liability.</p>

<p>
Chua Co faces a lawsuit from a supplier who is claiming damages due to alleged breach of contract in a past purchase agreement with the company.

<p> John alleges that, while he was employed with Lam Co, the company ruthlessly forced him to stay awake and work during this timeslot, thereby violating his religious principles and causing him mental anguish. John is claiming damages in the amount of $1 million. </p>
<p>The lawyer for Lam Co advises that this is a frivolous lawsuit with virtually no chance of the company losing or being forced to pay any damages.</p>
<p>Should Lam Co record a provision for the damages from the lawsuit? Should they disclose a contingent liability?</p>
<a href="javascript: void(0);" onClick="toggle('ex8_soln')">

<div id="ex8_soln" style="display:none;">
<p>There may be a present obligation based on a past event (forcing the ex-employee to work during naptime). The outcome (damages) depends on the court decision rather than the company&#39;s independent future actions. So this may be a provision or contingent liability.</p>

<p>The future losses are not more likely than not. Therefore, there is no provision.</p>

<p>The chances of any future loss are remote (approximately zero). Therefore, there is no need to record a contingent liability either. </p>

<h2 id="measurement">Measuring a provision</h2>

Provisions are recorded using a pre-tax current value basis: the best estimate at balance-sheet date of the pre-tax future loss amount arising from the provision (the amount needed to settle the provision). This should be a present value if the effect of discounting is significant. We will delve more into both these issues (updating and discounting) later in this section. Before that, let us establish the basic formulas.

<h3>Expected value</h3>

<p>If a provision arises from a collection of similar events, we can estimate the future loss as the average or expected future loss from the events. For example, for a warranty provision arising from sales of several units of a product, we can assess the amount of the future loss by taking the expected number of units that will lead to warranty claims (say x units) times the average cost per warranty claim (say y dollars). Both parameters x and y could be estimated based on past history and/or engineering standards established from quality control.</p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>A company has a one-year embedded warranty on sales of their product. Based on past history, the company assesses that the proportion of sold units that would require light repairs during the warranty period is <span class="ex9_light_perc"></span> percent; while the proportion of sold units that would require major repairs during the warranty period is <span class="ex9_major_perc"></span> permille (per thousand).</p>
<p>
The company assesses that the average cost of each light repair is $<span class="ex9_light_cpu"></span>, while the average cost of each major repair is $<span class="ex9_major_cpu"></span>.
</p>
<p>In 2024, the company sold <span class="ex9_units_sold"></span> units that are still under warranty at the year-end (31/12/2024).</p>
<p>What is the amount of the warranty provision at 31/12/2024?</p>

</div>

<h3>Most likely outcome</h3>

<p>When the provision represents a single unique event, like say losing a lawsuit, the amount of the provision is based on the <em>most likely outcome</em> rather than an expected value calculation. This could be provided by an expert opinion. We should consider whether other less likely outcomes are mostly lower or higher than the most likely outcome, and adjust our estimated amount downwards or upwards respectively.

<div class="example">
<h4>Example (SFRS(I) 1-37:40)</h4>
<p>A company has a provision for repair work due to damages to a plant built for a customer. The company assesses that the cost of rectifying the damage is most likely 1,000. This estimate assumes that the repair work will proceed smoothly according to a standard repair plan. But there is a significant chance that things won&#39;t go smoothly and additional  troubleshooting and repair work will be needed. In this case, the company should assess the amount of the provision as being some amount higher than 1,000.</p>
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Srini Co faces a lawsuit. The company lawyer determines that the probability of losing the lawsuit and facing damages is <span class="ex10_prob"></span> percent. The lawyer assesses that if damages are awarded, the amount of damages would reliably be in the range $<span class="ex10_low"></span> to $<span class="ex10_high"></span>. What is the amount of the provision for damages?</p>
<p>

<a href="javascript: void(0);" onClick="toggle('ex10_soln')">
Click here to toggle viewing the solution.
</a>
<div id="ex10_soln" style="display:none;">
<p>In the absence of information about which amounts are more likely, we make the minimal assumption that each number in the range $<span class="ex10_low"></span> to $<span class="ex10_high"></span> is equally likely. Then any amount in this range qualifies as a most likely outcome.</p> 

<p>We choose the midpoint of the range, i.e., $<span class="ex10_mid"></span> as our estimate of the provision amount  The logic is as follows:</p> 

<ul>
<li>
If we took a number  in the range below this midpoint we would need to adjust upwards.
</li>
<li>
If we chose a number in the range above this midpoint, we would need to adjust downwards.
</li>
<li>
The midpoint $<span class="ex10_mid"></span> is the choice where no adjustment is needed.
</li>   
</ul>
<p>Notice that we do not calculate an expected value. For example., we do not take the probability of damages times the estimated average damages. The probability here just helps us to decide if this is a provision or a contingent liability.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3>Present value</h3>

<p>If the effects of discounting are material, a provision should be measured at the balance-sheet date using its present value at the balance-sheet date.
</p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>See Tho Co has a two-year embedded warranty on goods sold. At the balance-sheet date 31/12/2024, the estimated amount of warranty claims in the next year 2025 is $<span class="ex11_amt25"></span>, and the estimated amount of warranty claims in the subsequent year 2026 is $<span class="ex11_amt26"></span>.</p>
<p>The company does not discount the current portion of the warranty liability (discounting is not significant), but does apply discounting to the non-current portion (discounting is significant). The discount rate is <span class="ex11_rate"></span> percent pa compounded annually.</p>
<p>In computing present values, the company applies the mid-year convention. Under this convention, the relevant cash flow for each year is assumed to occur in the <em>middle</em> of that year. Thus the midpoint of the first year would be at time 0.5 years from the measurement date, while the midpoint of the second year would be at time 1.5 years from the measurement date, and so on. This convention is often used as a convenient way to model cash flows that occur near-continuously through the year.</p>

<h3>Unwinding of discount</h3>

<p>When the present value increases each year due to the future loss becoming one year nearer (unwinding of discount), the resulting increase in the liability is treated as part of borrowing costs (usually interest expense).</p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Lim Co sells goods under a two-year embedded warranty. At 1/1/2024 (beginning of the financial year), the non-current warranty liability has a balance of $<span class="ex12_noncurr_bb"></span>. This is calculated based on the assumption that the related future cash flow would occur in the middle of 2025. The non-current liability beginning balance was computed as a present value using a discount rate of <span class="ex12_rate"></span> percent pa simple interest. The current liability is undiscounted.</p>

<h3>Present value calculations: rates and cashflows</h3>

<p>The present value of a future loss can be computed either using a risky cash flow discounted at a rate that appropriately reflects that risk (risk-adjusted rate); or using an estimated <em>certainty-equivalent</em> cashflow discounted at a risk-free rate.</p>

<p>
The <em>certainty-equivalent cashflow</em> is some fixed amount that we can pay a third party to take over the obligation from us.
</p>

<p>If we have a risky cash outflow <math><msub><mi>CF</mi><mi>risky</mi></msub></math> and a certainty-equivalent cash flow <math><msub><mi>CF</mi><mi>rf</mi></msub></math>; while the risk-free discount rate is <math><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>rf</mi></msub></math>, and the risk-adjusted discount rate is <math><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>ra</mi></msub></math>; and the risky cash outflow occurs at <em>t</em> years from the valuation date, then we have this equation (assuming the rates are based on compound interest):</p>

<p>To solve for the risk-adjusted rate, we can set the provision amount equal to the present value formula based on the risky cash flow discounted at the risk-adjusted rate, and solve for the risk-adjusted rate. The risky cash flow is estimated as the mid-point of the future-cashflow range, which midpoint is $<span class="ex13_mid"></span>.<p>

<h3>Counterintuitive?!</h3>

<p>The risk-free rate is <em>higher</em> than the risk-adjusted rate. This is the opposite of what we usually see in finance! Here is why:</p>

<p>For a provision, the present value is the amount we pay today to settle the uncertain future loss. If the future loss is a certain (risk-free) amount, we need to pay <em>less</em> today, i.e., a <em>more</em> discounted amount, i.e., an amount discounted at a <em>higher</em> discount rate.</p>

<p>If the future loss is more uncertain (risky), we would have to pay <em>more</em> today, i.e., a <em>less</em> discounted amount, i.e., an amount discounted at a <em>lower</em> discount rate.</p>

<p>This is a bit different from the typical situation in finance where the present value refers to the amount needed today to get a future benefit.</p>

<p>In provision calculations, it is not uncommon for the risk-adjusted discount rate to be negative.</p>

<h2 id="updating">Provisions must be updated</h2>

<p>Provisions are measured at a current value, not historical cost. A provision amount should be based on the best estimate at balance-sheet date of the future loss arising from the provision (or the amount required to settle the obligation). This estimate should be updated every year.</p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Kusnadi Co sells goods under a two-year warranty. At the start of 2024, the balance in the current warranty provision is $<span class="ex14_curr_bb"></span> (based on <span class="ex14_curr_bb_units"></span> units at a cost of $<span class="ex14_curr_bb_cpu"></span> per unit); while the balance in the noncurrent warranty provision is $<span class="ex14_noncurr_bb"></span> (based on <span class="ex14_noncurr_bb_units"></span> units at a cost of $<span class="ex14_noncurr_bb_cpu"></span> per unit).</p> 
<p>Discounting is not material.</p>
<p> Actual warranty claims during the year 2024 are $<span class="ex14_claims"></span>.</p>
<p>At the year-end 31/12/2024, the company estimates that the new noncurrent provision for the year should be based on <span class="ex14_noncurr_eb_units"></span> units at a cost of $<span class="ex14_noncurr_eb_cpu"></span> per unit, while the new current provision for the year (incremental to the amounts transferred from the noncurrent provision) would be based on <span class="ex14_curr_eb_units"></span> units at a cost of $<span class="ex14_curr_eb_cpu"></span> per unit. This updated cost per unit also applies to the anticipated warranty claims transferred from the noncurrent liability.</p>

<h2 id="specific">Specific types of provisions</h2>

We have already discussed the warranty provision. Here are some other common types of provisions.

<h3>Onerous contract</h3>

If we are legally bound by a contract under which we are forced to take unavoidable net losses due to past events, then we should record a provision for the future losses from the contract. Such a contract is called an onerous contract. 
<p></p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Chai Co hires a CEO from outside the firm on a 3-year contract with a salary of $<span class="ex15_sal"></span> per year. But within a few days of the contract being signed, the new CEO has a profound disagreement with the BOD and is fired. Under the terms of the CEO&#39;s contract, the company is unavoidably legally obliged to pay him all three years of his salary in full, even if he has been fired.</p>
<p>You can assume that the salary for each year is payable in full at the year-end. The discount rate for provisions is (expressed as a decimal) <span class="ex15_rate"></span> pa which is based on annual compounding. </p>
<p>Does this lead to a provision? If so, what is the amount of the provision?</p>

<a href="javascript: void(0);" onClick="toggle('ex15_soln')">

</a>
<div id="ex15_soln" style="display:none;">
<p>Yes, this is a provision (present legal obligation based on a past event [firing the CEO]; losses are virtually certain; the amount can be reliably measured). The provision arises from an onerous contract.</p>
<p>The amount of the provision is $<span class="ex15_prov"></span>, computed as follows:</p>

<h3>Levy</h3>

<p>A levy is a tax imposed on companies or individuals in some special circumstances.</p>
<p>An example could be a levy imposed on oil companies during a period when they make windfall profits due to oil supply bottlenecks caused by wars.</p>
<p>Another example would be <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/foreign-worker-levy/what-is-the-foreign-worker-levy">the manpower levy</a> in Singapore, which is charged to companies that hire foreign workers under some circumstances.</p>
<p>A company facing a levy usually should record its levy obligation as a provision.</p>
<p>For a levy based on revenues or profits (say a levy on windfall profits for oil companies), the levy provision should be based only on revenues that have already occurred at balance-sheet date (past events). It should not include any levy based on anticipated future revenues.</p>
<p>Similarly, for the manpower levy, the levy provision should be based only on the levy for foreign employees who are already employed by the firm at balance-sheet date, not on any proposed future hires.</p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Oil Co is an oil company in a country in SE Asia. The government in that country has imposed a levy of <span class="ex16_levy_rate"></span> percent on revenues of oil companies, which have reaped windfall profits due to wars affecting global oil supply.</p> 
<p>The levy will be for the current year (just completed) and next year.</p> 
<p>Oil Co has actual revenues of CU <span class="ex16_rev_y0"></span> in the currrent year, and projected revenues of CU <span class="ex16_rev_y1"></span> in the next year.</p>
<p>Show the journal entry to record the levy provision at the current-year balance-sheet date. The discount rate for non-current provisions is <span class="ex16_rate"></span> pa annually compounded (expressed as a decimal). Current provisions are undiscounted.</p>

<p>We only consider the levy arising from the current year revenues. There is no provision based on the projected future revenues.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Keung Co has <span class="ex17_num_curr"></span> foreign employees subject to a manpower levy. These employees have worked for the company throughout the current year.</p>
<p>
The levy amount per employee is $<span class="ex17_levy_pm"></span> per month for employees who have worked a full month or $<span class="ex17_levy_pd"></span> per day for employees who have worked for only part of a month.
</p>
<p>
The levy for each calendar month is paid by GIRO on the 17th of the subsequent month.
</p>
<p>
At financial year-end (Dec 31 xx), Keung Co has hired <span class="ex17_num_new"></span> new foreign employees (subject to levy), of whom <span class="ex17_num_new_joined"></span> employees have started working on <span class="ex17_date_joined"></span> December. The others will start working in January.
</p>
<p>Prepare the adjusting journal entry to update the levy provision at year end.</p>

<h3>Decommissioning</h3>

<p>A provision often arises for costs arising from obligatory dismantling and cleanup of a PPE asset at the end of its life. Under SFRS(I) 1-16:16(c), this provisional cost must be included as part of the initial acquisition cost of the PPE asset (if the obligation arises upon acquisition; if it arises later, it is added to the PPE cost at that later point). This provision is subsequently updated each year as required for provisions, which in turn would lead to updating the cost basis of the PPE and revised depreciation calculations each year.</p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>An oil company has set up an oil rig at a construction cost of $<span class="ex18_cost"></span> at 1/1/2024.</p>
<p>The company has a legal obligation to dismantle the rig and clean the seabed at the end of the rig&#39;s useful life (<span class="ex18_life"></span> years).</p>
<p>The expected future cost to dismantle the rig and clean the seabed is estimated to be between $<span class="ex18_low"></span> and $<span class="ex18_high"></span>.</p>
<p>The risk-adjusted discount rate for the provision is <span class="ex18_rate"></span> (expressed as a decimal) based on simple interest.</p>

<p>A restructuring is a major company reorganization such as a shutdown of a division, or a merger of divisions, or a major change in the management hierarchy structure. Restructuring involves significant future committed costs that may lead to a provision.</p>
<p>A restructuring provision usually arises from a constructive provision, since a legal requirement to restructure is unusual. SFRS(I) 1-37:72 specifies the conditions to establish this constructive provision:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The company should have approved a detailed formal plan for the restructuring; and
</li>
<li>
The company should have made this plan known to affected parties, either via an announcement or other communications, or by taking actions to start implementing the plan.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In the special case of a restructuring that involves a sale of a business unit, the restructuring obligation is deemed to arise only when a binding sale agreement is reached.
</p>
<p>In measuring the restructuring provision, we include only costs that arise from dismantling or rearranging the existing operations, not projected costs for future growth plans, or costs of ongoing existing operations.</p>
<p> For example, costs to pay golden handshakes to retrenched employees should be included, but costs to reskill or relocate affected employees or hire new employees should not be included in the provision.</p>
<p>Costs of discontinuing existing units should be included, e.g., lease termination costs, but costs of establishing new units should not.</p>
<p>Marketing or R&amp;D costs should likewise not be included.</p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Aswani Co has decided to drop a branded product and also close down a store dedicated to that product. They have drawn up a detailed plan for the discontinued operation and have received Board approval for this on 1/12/2024. They have also communicated the decision to all affected parties (affected employees, affected suppliers, the store landlord etc) via a circular email, and have also issued a public announcement, on 2/12/2024.</p>
<p>The action plan for the discontinued operation includes the following cost estimates:</p>
<p>Penalties due to early termination of the store lease will be $<span class="ex19_lease"></span>.</p>
<p>Separation costs for store employees who will be made redundant (golden handshakes) will amount to $<span class="ex19_golden"></span>.</p>
<p>The company will retain some affected employees who will be trained to fulfil other roles in the organization. The budgeted costs for such retraining are $<span class="ex19_retraining"></span>.</p>
<p>The company will relocate some affected employees to work overseas. The budgeted costs for relocating these employees are $<span class="ex19_relocation"></span>.</p>
<p>The company will conduct marketing research to probe customer opinions about the product removal, and the extent to which this might damage sales of other continuing product lines. The budgeted costs of the market research are $<span class="ex19_marketing"></span>.</p>
<p>When does a restructuring obligation (if any) arise? What is the amount of the restructuring provision, if any? You can assume that discounting is not material.</p>

<div id="ex19_soln" style="display:none">
<p>There is a constructive obligation on 2/12/2024, after the detailed plan has been approved and affected parties have been informed of the restructuring.</p>
<p>The amount of the provision would be $<span class="ex19_prov"></span>. This is obtained by adding the penalties due to lease termination, and the golden handshakes costs. The other budgeted costs mentioned are not allowable as part of the provision under SFRS(I) 1-37.</p>
