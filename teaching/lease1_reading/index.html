<h2 id="sof">Substance over form</h2>

<p>Consider a situation where we are comparing the option of leasing (renting) an asset vs buying it.</p>

<h3>Leasing vs buying</h3>

<p>In deciding whether to lease (rent) an asset versus buying it, we can compare the present value of the respective cash flows.</p>

<div class='example'>
<h4>Example 1: Leasing vs buying</h4>
<p><span class="ex1_coname"></span> is deciding whether to lease or buy an asset for 10 years. The annual rental is $<span class="ex1_rental"></span> per year paid in arrears (end of year).</p>

<p>The asset could be purchased for $<span class="ex1_cost"></span> using a mortgage loan with 10 equal annual payments in arrears carrying interest at <span class="ex1_int_rate"></span> percent annually compounded. For convenience, assume that the residual value of the asset after 10 years is negligible.</p>

<p>Which is better, leasing or buying?</p>


<p></p>

</a>
<div id="ex1_soln" style="display:none;">
<p>We can work out the equal annual payments for the mortgage, using an annuity formula, or the PMT function in Excel or a financial calculator.</p>

<p>The equal annual payment is $<span class="ex1_lessor_pmt"></span>.</p>

<p><span class="ex1_result"></span></p>

</div>
</div>

<p>An economist would argue that the example above is unrealistic. If markets are functioning properly, the present value of renting out an asset for its entire life should always be the same as that of selling it. </p>

<p>Accountants adopt this economist logic by treating such lease transactions as though they were an outright sale of the asset financed by a receivable equal to the present value of the lease payments.</p>

<p> This asserts the accounting principle of <em>substance over form</em>. In accounting for a lease transaction, what matters is the economic reality of the transaction (substance), not so much how it is legally structured (form).</p>

<h3>Substance over form</h3>

<p>In some circumstances, a transaction that is legally a lease may in economic terms more closely resemble a purchase of the leased asset funded by a stream of payments that resemble those from a mortgage loan.  For example, the lease term could be close to the entire life of the asset, so that the lessee (borrower) effectively controls the asset through most of its life. Another situation could be that the present value of the lease payments are approximately equal to the fair value of the leased asset at lease commencement, so that the lessee is effectively paying about as much for the lease as they would to buy the asset (which a rational party would not pay unless the value received from the use of the asset is equivalent to that from buying the asset.)</p>

<p>In such circumstances, we assert a <em>substance over form</em> criterion; and account for the lease as though the asset had been sold to the lessee in exchange for a receivable.</p>

<h2>Accounting for lessors</h2>

<p>In a lease (rental) agreement, the lessor is the supplier of the leased (rented) asset; while the lessee is the borrower of the leased asset. In this reading, we focus on the accounting for a lessor.</p>

<h3 id="lessor_type">Types of lessor</h3>

<h4>Financier lessor</h4>

<p>A <em>financier lessor</em> is a business whose business model is to buy an asset and rent it out; and who make money primarily from the spread between the periodic payments received from the lessee and the periodic mortgage payments they make to their supplier of finance. This business model is similar to that of a bank (financier) except that instead of lending cash, they are lending a fixed asset.</p>

<div class='example'>
<h4>Example 2: Financier lessor</h4>

<p><span class="ex2_coname"></span> is in the aircraft leasing business. They buy an aircraft for $<span class="ex2_cost"></span>, using a mortgage loan with equal annual payments of $<span class="ex2_lessor_pmt"></span> per year in arrears for 10 years, based on an annual interest rate of <span class="ex2_lessor_rate"></span> percent. They lease the aircraft to an airline for 10 years at an annual rental of $<span class="ex2_lessee_pmt"></span> paid in arrears. The stream of rental receipts from the aircraft is similar to those from lending $<span class="ex2_cost"></span> for 10 years via a mortgage loan with equal payments at the higher interest rate of <span class="ex2_lessee_rate"></span> percent. Like a bank, <span class="ex2_coname"></span> makes money via the spread between the effective interest rate they earn on their lending versus the effective interest rate they pay on their borrowing.</p>
</div>



<h4>Manufacturer-dealer lessor</h4>

<p>A manufacturer or dealer may offer a lease as an alternative to purchasing their product. The customer may prefer this option due to the payment pattern and avoiding the need to dispose of the used asset.</p>

<div class='example'>
<h4>Example 3: Manufacturer</h4>
<p>A computer manufacturer supplies desktop personal computers to a University. As an alternative to buying the computers outright, the manufacturer offers a three-year lease of the computers (approximately equal to their life).</p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div class='example'>
<h4>Example 4: Dealer</h4>
<p>A car dealer sells cars to retail customers. As an alternative to buying a car, the car dealer offers the option of leasing it for a fixed period.</p>
</div>

<p>In  this reading, we will by default take the viewpoint of a financier lessor, and will discuss the differences in accounting for a manufacturer-dealer lessor in the last section.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h2 id="lease_type">Operating and Finance leases</h2>

<p>Based on substance over form, we classify lease agreements for a lessor into:</p>

<ol>
<li>
Transactions whose economic substance or business purpose does represent a temporary lending of the asset in order to earn a periodic rental payment. Such leases are called <em>operating leases</em>.
</li>
<li>
Transactions whose economic substance or business purpose is similar to an outright sale of the asset in exchange for a stream of periodic payments (a receivable). Such leases are called <em>finance leases</em>.
</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h2 id="oplease">Operating leases</h2>

<p>For operating leases, the lease payments are treated as income when they occur. In the case of irregular lease payments, the standard advises that the periodic lease income should be an equal amount each period (straight-line calculation) unless an irregular pattern of recognizing income can be justified. Thus with the straight-line calculation, the periodic lease income would be:</p>

<math display="block">
 <mfrac>
   <mi>Total&nbsp;lease&nbsp;receipts</mi>
   <mi>Number&nbsp;of&nbsp;periods&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;lease&nbsp;term</mi>
 </mfrac>
 <mo>.</mo>
</math>

<p></p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example 5: Operating lease</h4>

<p><span class="ex5_coname"></span> leases out an asset for two years under an operating lease. The contractual lease payment is $<span class="ex5_y1"></span> at the end of Year 1, and $<span class="ex5_y2"></span> at the end of year 2.</p>

<h2 id="finlease">Finance lease</h2>

<p>A lease is treated as a finance lease if any one of the following conditions is satisfied:</p>

<ol>
<li>
The title to the asset (ownership) automatically passes to the lessee during or at the end of the lease term. 
</li>
<li>
The lease contract gives the lessee the right to buy the asset at a bargain price during the lease term (bargain purchase option).
</li>
<li>
The term of the lease is a <em>major</em> part of the asset useful life. As a thumbrule based on past US practice, we can use around 75% of the life as the lower limit of what is a <em>major part</em>.
</li>
<li>
The present value of the lease payments, discounted at the implicit interest rate of the lease (defined later), equals <em>substantially all</em> of the fair value of the asset at the time the lease agreement is decided (inception date of the lease). As a thumbrule based on past US practice, we can use around 90% of the fair value as the lower limit of what is <em>substantially all</em>.
</li>
<li>
The leased asset is so specialized that the only use that the lessor has for it is to lease it out to the particular lessee.
</li>
</ol>

<p>If any of these conditions is satisfied, the lease is in substance more like an outright sale of the asset than a rental arrangement.</p>

<p></p>

<div class='example'>
<h4>Example 6: Bargain purchase option</h4>

<p><span class="ex6_coname"></span> leases out an asset with fair value $<span class="ex6_fv"></span> for three years in exchange for three annual payments in advance of $<span class="ex6_pmt"></span> each. The lease agreement gives the lessee the right to buy the asset at the end of Year 2 at a price of $<span class="ex6_bpo"></span>, in which case they forgo the remaining lease payments.</p>

<p>Is this a finance lease?</p>

<h3>Finance lease accounting</h3>

<p>The <em>inception date</em> of the lease is the date when the lease was agreed upon or committed to.</p>

<p>The <em>commencement date</em> of the lease is the date from which the lease term actually starts.</p>

<p>The lessor treats a finance lease like a credit sale of the asset. At the commencement of the lease, the leased asset is credited as if sold and taken off the lessor&#39;s books. At the same time, a receivable is recognized in the amount of the present value of the lease payments that will be received in exchange.</p>

<td class="r">xxx</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="l">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cr Asset</td>
<td></td>
<td class="r">xxx</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Implicit interest rate</h3>

<p>For a financier lessor, the implicit interest rate is the discount rate under which:</p>



<p>The present value (at that rate) of:</p>
<ul>
 <li>the lease payments (including any guaranteed amount of residual value, and
 </li>
 <li>
  any ungaranteed residual value at lease-end;
 </li>
</ul>
<p>EQUALS:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fair value of the leased asset at lease inception, PLUS</li>
<li>any initial direct costs that the lessor incurs in order to establish the lease (lessor IDC).</li>
</ul>

<p>The fair value of the asset plus the lessor IDC represents what the lessor has given up in the lease transaction.</p>

<p>The present value of the lease payments plus the present value of the unguaranteed residual value at lease-end, represent what the lessor gets in exchange.</p>

<p>These should be equal in a fair market transaction.</p>

<p>Lease payments typically include the periodic rental payments plus the guaranteed residual value at lease-end.</p>

<p>If the periodic payment is a mix of rental payments plus payments for something else such as reimbursement of executory costs, we should exclude amounts that are not directly for the rental.</p>

<div class='example'>
<h4>Example 10: Implicit interest rate</h4>

<p><span class="ex10_coname"></span> leases out an asset with fair value $<span class="ex10_fv"></span> in exchange for two annual payments of $<span class="ex10_pmt"></span> in advance. These include an amount each year of $<span class="ex10_exec"></span> for reimbursement of asset maintenance costs undertaken by the lessor. The lessor anticipates that the asset will have a residual value of $<span class="ex10_rv"></span> at the end of the lease term, none of it guaranteed. The lessor incurs initial direct costs of $<span class="ex10_idc"></span> to set up the lease.</p>

<h2 id="mfr_dlr">Manufacturer-dealer lessor</h2>

<p>The accounting for a manufacturer-dealer lessor differs from that for a financier lessor primarily in the initial recognition of a finance lease. The later accounting for the lease receivable is similar to that for a financier lessor.</p>

<h3>Implicit interest rate</h3>

<p>For a manufacturer-dealer lessor, we treat the finance lease similarly to a regular sale of goods. The lessor initial direct costs would be classified similarly to &quot;selling costs&quot; in this case, and consistent with the treatment of selling costs in a regular sales transaction, would be expensed, not capitalized. Consistent with this logic, the lessor IDC is not reflected as part of the implicit interest rate calculation for a manufacturer-dealer lessor. The equation becomes:</p>

<p>The present value (at the implicit interest rate) of:</p>
<ul>
 <li>the lease payments (including any guaranteed amount of residual value, and
 </li>
 <li>
  any ungaranteed residual value at lease-end;
 </li>
</ul>
<p>EQUALS:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fair value of the leased asset at lease inception.</li>
</ul>

<div class='example'>
<h4>Example 12: Implicit interest rate for manufacturer-dealer</h4>

<p><span class="ex12_coname"></span>, a dealer, leases out an asset with fair value $<span class="ex12_fv"></span> in exchange for two annual payments of $<span class="ex12_pmt"></span> in advance. These include an amount each year of $<span class="ex12_exec"></span> for reimbursement of asset maintenance costs undertaken by the lessor. The lessor anticipates that the asset will have a residual value of $<span class="ex12_rv"></span> at the end of the lease term, none of it guaranteed.

<h3>Market rate</h3>

<p>Unlike a financier lessor, the manufacturer-dealer lessor does not primarily make money from the interest rate spread between the implicit interest rate and their borrowing rate. Rather, they make money from the profit on the sale, or the gap between the sale price and their production costs for the leased item. </p>

<p>The manufacturer-dealer lessor may therefore sometimes structure the finance lease transaction so that it reflects a lower-than-market promotional implicit interest rate on the lease, or even a zero or negative interest rate. In this case, it would be misleading to use the implicit interest rate to compute the present value of the lease payments.</p>

<p> The standard therefore stipulates that, in situations where the implicit interest rate deviates from the market interest rate, we should use the market interest rate instead to calculate the lease receivable. (Effectively, we can just use the market interest rate always.)</p>

<div class='example'>
<h4>Example 13: Promotional rate</h4>

<p><span class="ex13_coname"></span>, a dealer, leases out an asset with fair value $<span class="ex13_fv"></span> in exchange for two annual payments of $<span class="ex13_pmt"></span> in advance.

<h3>Sales and COGS</h3>

<h4>Sales revenue</h4>

<p>Sales revenue is computed as the present value of the lease payments, discounted at the market interest rate. This is the same as the lease receivable less the present value of the unguaranteed residual value.</p>

<p>If the present value of the lease payments is greater than the fair value of the leased asset, then the sales revenue is capped at the fair value.</p>

<h4>Cost of goods sold (COGS)</h4>

<p>Cost of goods sold is computed using the asset carrying amount in inventory (applying the FIFO or weighted average convention as per the company policy) LESS the present value of the unguaranteed residual value (discounted at the market interest rate).</p>

<p>Effectively, the unguaranteed residual value portion of the asset is treated as a non-sale, just a temporary loan of the asset.</p>

<div class='example'>
<h4>Example 14: Sales and COGS</h4>

<p><span class="ex14_coname"></span>, a dealer, leases out an asset with fair value $<span class="ex14_fv"></span> in exchange for two annual payments of $<span class="ex14_pmt"></span> in advance. The lessor anticipates that the asset will have a residual value of $<span class="ex14_rv"></span> at the end of the lease term, none of it guaranteed. The lessor incurs initial direct costs of $<span class="ex14_idc"></span> to set up the lease.</p>
<p>The market interest rate is <span class="ex14_iir"></span> percent. The value of the leased asset in inventory using FIFO is $<span class="ex14_inv"></span>. Show the journal entry to record the sale transaction.</p>

<p>The implicit interest rate of this lease is zero, which deviates from the actual market interest rate. Therefore, we use the market interest rate instead.</p>
