<h3>Financial instrument</h4>
<p>A financial instrument is: &quot; any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. &quot; (IAS 32:11) </p>

<div id="deriv">
<h3>Derivatives</h3>

<p>A derivative is a contract that fulfils the following three characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Its value changes in response to the value of some other number, known as the underlying. 
</li>
<li>
It is settled in future, not on the spot.
</li>
<li>
At the initiation of the contract, there is typically no outlay from either party or just a small outlay (if the contract is at current market terms).
</li>
</ul>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example--Forward contract</h4>
<p>Poh Co enters a forward contract to sell <span class="ex5_no"></span> bales of cotton at a future date <span class="ex5_days"></span> days from today, in exchange for a fixed payment at that date of CU <span class="ex5_F"></span> per bale. This matches the current market price for future settlement at that date (the current forward price of cotton).</p>
<p>This contract is a derivative because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The value of the contract at any time before settlement depends on the price of cotton at that time (the underlying).</li>
<li>There is no upfront payment from either party to the other when the contract is entered.</li>
<li>Settlement is in the future.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p></p>
<div class="example">
<h4>Example--futures contract</h4>
<p>A futures contract is a forward contract that trades on an exchange. In such a situation, typically, the exchange requires both parties to put down a margin deposit, and to cover gains and losses in cash on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Ho Co buys futures contracts on an exchange to sell <span class="ex6_00tons"> </span> metric tonnes of iron ore at a date that is <span class="ex6_days"> </span> days from today. The current forward price per metric tonne for settlement at that date is USD <span class="ex6_F"></span>, which is also the fixed price reflected in the futures contract. At entry, Ho Co must make a deposit with the exchange in the amount of USD <span class="ex6_deposit"></span>.</p>
<p>This contract is a derivative because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The value of the contract at any time before settlement depends on the spot price  of iron ore at that time (the underlying).</li>
<li>There is no upfront payment from either party to the other when the contract is entered. (The margin deposit is refundable).</li>
<li>Settlement is in the future.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p></p>
<div class="example">
<h4>Example -- Options</h4>
<p>See Tho Co buys options to sell <span class="ex7_no"></span> shares of Ho Co (put options) at a date that is <span class="ex7_days"></span> days from today at a fixed price of SGD <span class="ex7_S"></span> per share, which matches the current market price. See Tho Co pays SGD <span class="ex7_V0"></span> per option to buy one share.</p>
<p>This contract is a derivative because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The value of the contract at any time before settlement depends on the Ho Co share price at that time (the underlying).</li>
<li>The investment in the option is a small amount.</li>
<li>Settlement is in the future.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Accounting for derivatives</h2>

<h3>General principles</h3>
<p>Companies typically invest in derivatives as a means to reduce various kinds of risk. For example, a company may use a forward contract to lock in to a fixed future price or exchange rate for a future transaction, and thereby avoid exposure to swings in prices or exchange rates. This role of derivatives is referred to as &quot;hedging&quot;. In this reading, we will consider the &quot;default&quot; accounting for derivatives when they are not used for hedging. We will examine hedge accounting separately.</p>
<p>The following principles apply to the accounting for derivatives (when not used in hedging):</p>
<ul>
<li>
They are stated on the balance sheet at their fair value at the balance-sheet date.
</li>
<li>
Gains and losses due to changes in fair value are reflected in the income statement (profit and loss).
</li>
<li>
Depending on the market expectation, the fair value of the entity&apos;s position in a derivative contract could be positive or negative. If positive, the derivative is an asset, if negative, it is a liability.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fwd">Forward contracts</h3>
<p>Forward contracts give the holder the right (and obligation) to buy or sell some fixed number of units of an item, say A units, at a fixed future maturity date, say t years from today, at a fixed price per unit, called the strike price or the exercise price, say K.</p>
<p>The fair value of a contract to sell A units of an item at strike price K at time t is given by:</p>
<math display="block">
 <mn>A</mn>
 <mo>&times;</mo>
 <mo>(</mo>
 <mn>K</mn>
 <mo>&minus;</mo>
 <mn>F</mn>
 <mo>)</mo>
 <mo>&times;</mo>
 <msub>
 <mn>d</mn>
 <mn>t</mn>
 </msub>
</math>
<p>where F is the strike price offered currently by the market in new forward contracts for settlement at t, and <math display="inline"><msub><mn>d</mn><mn>t</mn></msub></math> is the discount factor (present value factor) for a maturity of t. This is the amount that a rational person would be willing to pay us (or if negative, the amount that they would require us to pay them) in order for them to take over our position in the contract.</p>
<p>Similarly, the fair value of a forward contract to <i>buy</i> A units of an item at strike price K at time t is given by:</p>
<math display="block">
 <mn>A</mn>
 <mo>&times;</mo>
 <mo>(</mo>
 <mn>F</mn>
 <mo>&minus;</mo>
 <mn>K</mn>
 <mo>)</mo>
 <mo>&times;</mo>
 <msub>
 <mn>d</mn>
 <mn>t</mn>
 </msub>
</math>
<p>It is the mirror image of the fair value of the contract to sell.The expected gain or loss on the sell side is matched by an equal loss or gain respectively on the buy side.<p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example--forward contract fair value</h4>
<p>Poh Co holds a forward contract to sell <span class="ex8_A"></span> EUR at a date <span class="ex8_days"></span> days from today. The discount factor for that maturity is <span class="ex8_dt"></span>. The strike price under the contract is <span class="ex8_K"></span> SGD per EUR. The current market forward exchange rate for settlement at <span class="ex8_days"></span> days is <span class="ex8_F"></span> SGD per EUR. What is the current fair value of the forward contract?</p>

<h3 id="fut">Futures contracts</h3>
<p>A futures contract is a standardized forward contract that trades on an exchange. Apart from standardized terms and quoted prices, markets trading futures contracts typically require parties to settle gains and losses daily in cash. Also a standard requirement is a margin deposit when the contract is entered, which is typically a fixed percentage of the contract &quot;notional amount&quot; (A &times; K). </p>
<p>In accounting for a futures contract, initially, the margin deposit is recorded (as an asset). Subsequently, gains and losses each day are recorded as receipts or payments of cash. On final contract settlement, the margin deposit is recovered.</p>

<div class="example">

<h4>Example -- Futures</h4>
<p>Tan Co enters a futures contract on 15-Oct-20x5 to sell <span class="ex10_A"></span> metric tonnes of iron ore at a fixed price of
<span class="ex10_K"></span> dollars per metric tonne on 17-Oct-20x5. The strike price under the contract matches the forward price on this date. The market requires a margin deposit equal to <span class="ex10_deposit_perc"></span> percent of the contract notional amount. The market requires daily cash settlement of gains and losses on the contract. Final settlement is in cash rather than delivery of iron ore.</p>
<p>The closing forward prices for 17-Oct-20x5 settlement are (dollars per metric tonne): <span class="ex10_F_16"></span> on 16-Oct-20x5, and <span class="ex10_F_17"></span> on 17-Oct-20x5.</p>
<p>Assume for simplicity that the company withdraws cash received from gains and pays cash for losses while keeping the margin deposit balance unchanged.</p>
<p>Discounting is not material.</p>

<h3 id="opt">Options</h3>
<p>Options contracts give the holder the right to buy or sell some units say A of an item, say a share, at a fixed strike price, say K, at a fixed date or dates in the future.</p>
<p>Options to buy are referred to as call options. Options to sell are referred to as put options.</p>
<p>The holder of the option does not have to exercise the option if it is not profitable to do so. They can allow the option to expire unexercised.</p>
<p>Since an option offers a profit or at least no loss on exercise, it is always an asset to the holder. Conversely, it is always a liability to the seller or writer (in options jargon, selling or issuing an option is referred to as writing the option). For the same reason, option contracts always have a price or fair value above zero, even at initiation.</p>
<p>Like the other derivatives we studied, options are recorded at their fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in fair value flowing through the income statement.</p>

<div class="example">

<h4>Example -- options accounting</h4>
<p>Lin Co buys <span class="ex11_A"></span> put options on 15-Jun-20x5, each giving the right to sell a share of Listco at a strike price of <span class="ex11_K"></span> at the exercise date 15-Jul-20x5. The price of the put options is <span class="ex11_V0"></span> on the purchase date.</p>
<p>On the balance-sheet date, 30-Jun-20x5, the price of a Listco share is <span class="ex11_S1"></span>. The fair value of each put option on this date is <span class="ex11_V1"></span>. </p>
<p>On the settlement date, 15-Jul-20x5, the price of a Listco share is <span class="ex11_S2"></span>.

<h2 id="l_vs_e">Liability or Equity</h2>

<p>IAS 32 (Singapore FRS(I) 1-32) addresses the question of whether an obligation should be classified as a liability or equity item on the balance sheet.</p>

<p>Under this standard, an obligation can be classified as an equity item if and only if both the following conditions are satisfied:</p>

<ul>
<li>
There is no obligation to pay cash or any other financial asset.
</li>
<li>
If there is an obligation to deliver the entity&quot;s own shares, the number of shares to be delivered should be fixed, not variable.
</li>
</ul>

<p>For instance, an obligation to deliver a fixed dollar amount in the form of the entity&apos;s own shares at the current market price would be classified as a liability, not an equity item. The number of shares delivered is variable depending on the market price at delivery. In the view of the standard, this obligation is primarily to deliver a fixed dollar amount rather than to transfer the risks and rewards of ownership.</p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example -- AT1 securities</h4>
<p>Banks are required by Central Bank rules to maintain sufficient levels of &quot;Tier 1 Capital&quot;, which is a slightly broader category than ordinary share capital and reserves. This leads them to hold so-called &quot;Additional Tier 1&quot; (AT1) securities that are somewhat like preference shares. Depending on the detailed terms of these securities, they could be classified as liabilities or equity applying IAS 32.</p>
<p>For instance, UOB in their 2024 annual report list several non-cumulative non-convertible perpetual capital securities with periodic payments similar to preference share dividends (i.e., UOB decides whether to pay). These securities are redeemable at the bank&apos;s option. These are classified as equity instruments and included in equity. There is no obligation to pay cash.</p>
<p>By contrast, Maybank classifies their AT1 securities as a liability in their 2024 annual report. These are 4.1% Sukuk Mudharabah (shariah-compliant perpetual bonds). While redemption is at the bank&apos;s option, the periodic payments are not purely discretionary, and so constitute an obligation to pay cash.</p>
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example -- DBS scrip dividend</h4>
<p>DBS offers some shareholders the option to receive their dividend in the form of shares rather than cash. The related dividend obligation is still a liability (dividend payable) not an equity item, since DBS still has the obligation to pay cash to these shareholders. Further, the number of shares delivered is variable if the shareholders opt for a scrip dividend.</p>
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example -- Fragrance Group 2010 bonus issue</h4>
<p>Fragrance Group offered a 1 for 1 bonus issue in 2010. The (notional) issue price for the bonus issue was fixed at $0.0338512. The bonus distribution was recorded by transferring the issue price amount from retained earnings to ordinary share capital.</p>
<p>Prior to the distribution, the obligation to distribute the bonus shares would have led to an equity item, called say bonus shares distributable. This obligation is not a liability. It is an obligation to deliver the entity&apos;s own shares. Also, the number of shares to deliver is fixed.</p>
</div>

<p></p>
<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>
<p></p>

<h2 id="conv">Convertible bonds</h2>

<p>Some debt obligations could include embedded options to deliver the entity&apos;s own shares. In such cases, IAS 32 (Singapore FRS(I) 1-32) prescribes split accounting. The obligation should be analyzed as a combination of a straight debt obligation and an obligation to deliver equity. Then each of these components should be recorded as liability or equity respectively, and accounted for separately.</p>
<p>The typical example is a convertible bond, which gives the holder the right to convert the face value of the bond into a fixed number of the issuer&apos;s shares at a conversion date which is prior to or at the bond maturity date.</p>
<p>We analyze the convertible bond into a combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A straight debt (non-convertible) instrument with similar terms, recorded as a liability (an obligation to deliver cash);
</li>
<li>
An option to convert the bond to a fixed number of shares, recorded as equity (an obligation to deliver shares).
</li>
</ul>
<p>The procedure to do so is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The gross proceeds (before deducting issue costs) is allocated between the liability and equity components as follows:
<ul>
<li>
The gross amount of the liability portion is set to be equal to the fair value of an equivalent non-convertible bond;
</li>
<li>
The remaining portion of the gross proceeds is allocated to the conversion option in equity.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Under IFRS 9 (Singapore FRS(I) 9), the initial amount of the liability or equity item must be net of the issue costs. These issue costs are allocated between the debt and equity components in the same proportion as the gross proceeds. 
</li>
<li>
Under IAS 12 (Singapore FRS(I) 1-12), any deferred tax liability related to the initial equity item must be reflected as a direct reduction in the equity item initial amount rather than as deferred tax expense.
</li>
</ol>

<div class="example">

<h4>Example -- Deferred tax for convertible bonds</h4>
<p>In many jurisdictions, the tax deductions for interest on convertible bonds treat the entire convertible bond as a single straight debt security, with the tax calculation of effective interest rate being based on the entire initial net proceeds. This leads to strictly lower total interest deductible amounts over the bond life, as compared to the interest calculated with the initial liability computed based on split accounting. This leads to taxable temporary differences, and a deferred tax liability. Mechanically, the initial tax basis of the convertible bond is higher than the initial carrying amount.</p>
<p>It is easier to see this with a zero-coupon bond, which just pays a lumpsum at maturity with no periodic payments. Suppose we have a zero-coupon convertible bond, which pays 100 at maturity, or is converted to 100 shares at maturity. The total net proceeds for the convertible bond are <span class="ex15_proceeds"></span>. This is allocated as <span class="ex15_debt"></span> to liability, and <span class="ex15_equity"></span> to the conversion option. For accounting purposes, the total amount of interest expense accruing until maturity is the difference between the amount of 100 paid at maturity and the initial liability amount <span class="ex15_debt"></span>, or <span class="ex15_accint"></span>.</p>
<p>For tax purposes however, in that jurisdiction, the entire convertible bond is treated as debt. Then the total amount of interest deductions available over the bond life is given by the repayment amount of 100 less the initial total net proceeds of <span class="ex15_proceeds"></span> or <span class="ex15_taxint"></span>. The income tax rate is 17 percent.</p>
<p>The amount of future interest expense that will not be deductible in future will lead to taxable temporary differences and a deferred tax liability. We can see that this amount mechanically equals the portion of the net proceeds allocated to equity. We are required to directly record the related deferred tax amount in equity when initially recognizing the convertible bond. The equity portion of the convertible bond will be reduced by this amount.</p>
<p>Show the journal entry to record the deferred tax on this convertible bond. What is the amount of the equity portion after recording deferred tax?</p>

<h4>Example -- convertible bond initial recognition</h4>
<p>A convertible bond is issued, with gross proceeds from the issue being <span class="ex16_gross"></span>. A non-convertible bond with the same terms is estimated to have a fair value of <span class="ex16_debt_gross"></span> at the issue date.</p>
<p>Total issue costs for the convertible bond amount to <span class="ex16_issue_total"></span>.</p>
<p>For tax purposes, interest deductions are calculated based on treating the entire proceeds as a liability. The income tax rate is 17 percent.</p>
<p>Show the journal entries to record the initial amounts of the liability and equity components of the convertible bond, as well as the related deferred tax.</p>
