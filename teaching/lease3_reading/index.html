  <p>This reading is based on the prescriptive guidance in Singapore FRS(I) 16 <em>Leases</em></p>  
  <h2>Learning outcomes</h2>
  <p>After studying this reading, you should be able to:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Account for a bargain purchase option (BPO).</li>
 <li>Account for a sale-leaseback.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="bpo">Bargain purchase option</h2>

<p>A bargain purchase option (BPO) is the right for the lessee to buy the leased asset during the lease term at a price that is clearly a bargain, that is, a rational person would buy the asset at that price.</p>

<p>If the lease contract contains a BPO, then we assume that the lessee will exercise it. Then the lease payments end with the bargain purchase.</p>

<p>The right-of-use asset in this case is depreciated over the asset life rather than the lease term. After the purchase occurs, it is retitled.</p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Lessee Co leases (as lessee) an asset for two years, in exchange for two annual payments of $<span class="ex1_pmt"></span> in advance. Lessor Co is the lessor (a financier lessor). The lessor IDC is $<span class="ex1_lessor_idc"></span>, and the lessee IDC is $<span class="ex1_lessee_idc"></span>. The estimated residual value at the end of the full lease term is $<span class="ex1_rv"></span>, none of it guaranteed. The asset fair value at lease inception is $<span class="ex1_fv"></span>. The lease contract gives Lessee Co the right to buy the asset at the end of one year at a price of $<span class="ex1_bpo_price"></span>. The asset life is three years.</p>
<p>Prepare journal entries relating to the lease for the lessee and the lessor.</p>

<div id="ex1_soln" style="display:none;">
<p>We can derive the implicit interest rate to be <span class="ex1_iir_perc"></span> percent. This is computed based on lease payments that are just two cash flows, the first advance payment and then the BPO exercise. The later payments and residual value are ignored, as assuming that the BPO is exercised, these will never happen.</p>

<h2 id="sale_leaseback">Sale-leasebacks</h2>

<p>A sale-leaseback is a transaction where the owner of an asset sells it to a financier lessor and then immediately leases it back for some fixed period. The usual business purpose of this transaction is to generate cash from an illiquid asset while continuing to use it.</p>

<p>In substance, some sale-leaseback transactions may be viewed as similar to a secured loan. IFRS 16 (Singapore FRS(I) 16) requires us to assess whether the initial sale of the asset is a true sale under IFRS 15 (Singapore FRS(I) 15); a true sale meaning that control of the asset is truly transferred to the buyer at point of sale in substance rather than just in form. It the transaction is determined to be not a true sale, then it is accounted for just as a secured loan, not as a lease.</p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>

<p>Seller-Lessee Co has an asset with fair value CU <span class="ex2_fv"></span> (at sale-leaseback inception). The company purchased the asset <span class="ex2_age"></span> years ago at an acquisition cost of CU <span class="ex2_cost"></span>, and the current carrying amount is CU <span class="ex2_ca"></span>.</p>

<p>Seller-Lessee Co sells the asset to Buyer-Lessor Co at a price of CU <span class="ex2_prc"></span>, and immediately leases it back for <span class="ex2_remlife"></span> years, its remaining life, in exchange for annual lease payments of CU <span class="ex2_pmt"></span> in advance.</p>

<p>The accountants for both parties (independently) determine that this is not a true sale under IFRS 15 (Singapore FRS(I) 15). As such, the asset is accounted for as before, and the transaction is treated as a loan with Seller-Lessee borrowing CU <span class="ex2_prc"></span> and repaying it in <span class="ex2_remlife"></span> instalments of  CU  <span class="ex2_pmt"></span> per year in advance.</p>

<p>Henceforth, we will only consider the situation where the initial sale is viewed as a true sale. In this case the following rules apply.</p>

<ol>
<li>
The initial sale is always recorded as being for sales proceeds equal to the fair value of the asset.
<ol type="a">
<li>
If the sale proceeds are less than the fair value, we account for this by treating the difference as an imputed advance lease payment on the leaseback. That is, we account for the sale as if the buyer-lessor paid the full fair value, and then the seller-lessee immediately gave back some amount as an advance payment on the leaseback.
</li>
<li>
If the sale proceeds are greater than the fair value, we account for this by treating the extra amount as a separate loan from the buyer-lessor to the seller-lessee.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
The right-of-use (ROU) asset is measured as follows at the start of the leaseback. If CA is the carrying amount of the asset on the seller-lessee's books just prior to the sale, FV is the fair value of the asset at sale-leaseback inception, and LL is the initial lease liability (before any advance payments), then the ROU asset is initially measured at:
<math display="block">
<mn>CA</mn>
<mo>&times;</mo>
<mfrac>
<mn>LL</mn>
<mn>FV</mn>
</mfrac>
</math>
</li>
Subsequently it is depreciated over the leaseback term.
</ol>

<h3>Sale-leaseback with sale at fair value</h3>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Seller-Lessee Co has an asset with fair value CU <span class="ex3_fv"></span> and carrying amount CU <span class="ex3_ca"></span> (cost of CU <span class="ex3_cost"></span> less accumulated depreciation of CU <span class="ex3_ad"></span>). The asset has a remaining life of <span class="ex3_remlife"></span> years.</p>
<p>Seller-Lessee Co sells the asset to Buyer-Lessor Co for proceeds of CU <span class="ex3_fv"></span>, i.e., equal to the fair value. Buyer-Lessor then immediately leases back the asset for <span class="ex3_term"></span> years in exchange for <span class="ex3_term"></span> equal annual payments of CU <span class="ex3_pmt"></span> in advance.</p>
<p>Seller-Lessee Co has a borrowing cost of <span class="ex3_iir_perc"></span> percent.</p>
<p>
The leaseback is an operating lease for Buyer-Lessor Co.

<h3>Sale-leaseback with sale at more than fair value</h3>

<p>In this case, we compute the loan liability as the portion of the sales price that is above the fair value.</p>

<p>Then the lease liability (before advance payments) is given by the difference between the present value of the leaseback payments and the loan liability amount.</p>

<p>We also have to split the periodic payments under the leaseback into payments for the lease and payments for the loan. We do this in proportion to the amounts of the initial lease liability (before advance payments) and loan liability.</p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Seller-Lessee Co has an asset with fair value CU <span class="ex5_fv"></span> and carrying amount CU <span class="ex5_ca"></span> (cost of CU <span class="ex5_cost"></span> less accumulated depreciation of CU <span class="ex5_ad"></span>). The asset has a remaining life of <span class="ex5_remlife"></span> years.</p>
<p>Seller-Lessee Co sells the asset to Buyer-Lessor Co for proceeds of CU <span class="ex5_prc"></span>, i.e., CU <span class="ex5_loan"></span> more than the fair value.
